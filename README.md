# Discode - Discord RPC Extension

I decided my very first use of Typescript and Visual Studio Code's API was going to be to remake the famed Code extensions that display editor info on your Discord profile through Discord's RPC feature.

Over the past three weeks, I put together this extension that:

- features over 1,600 assets
- can display information about the current:
    - folder
    - file
    - workspace
- can link to a GitHub repository
- includes support for when debugging
- has its own output tab when logging

### Undocumented

If there are parts of the setup that aren't really documented, do let me know. I'm not exactly that interested in decorating this project at the moment, so the most you'll get is comments in the code explaining what it does.
